# REST API Project

This is a README file for my first REST API project in Django with the Django REST framework.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a RESTful API using Django and the Django REST framework. It will provide endpoints for various operations related to your application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like cURL or a web browser. Here are some example endpoints:

- `Products GET /product/`: Retrieve a list of all product.
- `Product POST /product/`: Create a new product.
- `Product PUT /product/{id}/`: Update a specific product.
- `Product DELETE /product/{id}/`: Delete a specific product.

- `Home GET /`: Retrieve a list of home data.
- `Product POST /post/`: Create a new home data.
- `Product PUT /put/{id}/`: Update a specific home data.
- `Product DELETE /delete/{id}/`: Delete a specific home data.

Feel free to modify the endpoints and add your own functionality as needed.
